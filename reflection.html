    <h1>Project Reflection</h1>

    <h3>1. What was the most difficult part?</h3>
    <p>The hardest part of this assignment is to insert the codes I am not familiar with and I need the aid of my friends to dicuss and find out what code to be inserted.</p>

    <h3>2. What did you learn about HTML?</h3>
    <p>I learned that every webpage requires a specific structure to function. It needs html, head, and body tags. I learned that the head is for browser information, while the body contains everything the user actually sees.</p>

    <h3>3. How does this relate to the theme?</h3>
    <p>Punk culture prioritized the message over the packaging. By using simple HTML without complex styling, this project strips away distractions and forces the reader to focus entirely on the text and the articles, just like the original zine intended.</p>
